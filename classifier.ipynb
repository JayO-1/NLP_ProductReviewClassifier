    "\n",
    "The neural network I decided to use was a Bidirectional LSTM, as I believed that for this particular use case, where the ordering of the words in each review would influence subsequent semantic meaning, I could achieve a higher accuracy with a model that was able to analyse text from both left to right and right to left. This involved an embedding layer, followed by the Bidirectional LSTM followed by a sigmoid layer for classification, with binary cross entropy loss as my loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "I first determined a way of parsing the data within the corpus to construct a training set. I did not believe that feeding entire reviews, which are made up of multiple sentences, directly into my model would prove successful as this would mean the input sequences would be very large. This is a problem, as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. With longer sequences, even though LSTMs help to mitigate this, we can begin to encounter the\n",
    "vanishing gradient problem\n",
    "2. Longer sequences result in a Neural Network that is quite large, leading to longer training times\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above, reviews can be difficult to assign to a single label as they will often have both positive and negative elements to them as well as unannotated sentences, leading to ambiguity with regards to how best to classify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, to circumnavigate these issues, I decided to process the corpus on a sentence-by-sentence basis. Each annotated sentence would be given a label of 1 if the opinion was positive and 0 if the opinion was negative (which is why I use a sigmoid layer for classification). The idea here is that if one wanted to use this system to classify longer articles, they could simply aggregate the scores for each sentence, then threshold the result."

Analysing the results, I determined that with appropriate hyperparameter selection the model performs well considering the small amount of training data (approx. 2k sentences), achieving an average accuracy of around 72% across 5 folds. The hyperparameters tuned in this case were the learning rate and the number of epochs. Optimal results were achieved with a learning rate of 0.0001 and 13 to 15 epochs.\n",
